# 🛡️ Healthcare Data Anonymization
This project demonstrates practical **data anonymization techniques** applied to a **sample healthcare dataset** using Python.  
It applies **differential privacy** to numerical columns and **k-anonymity** strategies to categorical columns, helping protect sensitive information while retaining data utility.

---
## 📌 Objectives
- Apply **Differential Privacy** for anonymizing numerical attributes by adding Laplace noise.
- Implement **K-Anonymity** strategies — suppression, generalization, and synthetic replacement — for categorical attributes.
- Generate an anonymized dataset that preserves privacy while allowing further analysis.
